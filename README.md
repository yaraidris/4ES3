# 4ES3 Lab Project
Developed a TicTacToe and WhackAMole Game using Renesas Synergy SK S7G2 Board and E2 Studio.
Games include 3x3 push buttons and LEDs
TicTacToe
- Different colour LEDs light up depending on player turn.
- LEDs flash specific colours to indicate game winner or tie.
Whack a Mole

- Higher the score, the faster the delay becomes.
- Player has 3 lives, if all lives lost score is displayed using LEDs then game resets.
